# ToDoListScreens
--------------------------------------------------------About-----------------------------------------------------
Hello! Welcome to our To-Do List Program! Our names are Chea and Sam. We are currently seniors at Immaculate Heart High School! Our goal was to build a to do list manager in Java that would allow users to keep track of tasks throughout their month. Whether it be personal tasks or work related tasks, we wanted our program to be efficient and organized. 


----------------------------------------------------How To Use------------------------------------------------
The program is designed to make all task related functions extremely easy! Whether you want to edit, add, or delete,a task there is a function for it!

Here are the functions that our program has:

1. View all tasks
2. View a specific list
3. Add a new task
4. Check off task
5. Edit a task
6. View task by priority
7. Create New To-Do List


Our program is easy to navigate using the table of contents that has the buttons to access these functions.



------------------------------------------------Other Notes-----------------------------------------
- Though imcomplete, we hope to revisit this program in the future and improve/finish it


Thank you!
